## 🚀 Features

- 🎮 Classic chess gameplay with a quantum twist
- 🧠 AI opponent using the Minimax strategy with configurable depth
- 🔁 Randomized quantum moves to simulate uncertainty
- 🖼️ Beautiful board and piece designs using Pygame
- ✅ Easy to play with keyboard and mouse inputs

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Pygame

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## 🕹️ How to Play

1. Clone this repository or download the ZIP.
2. Navigate to the project folder.
3. Run the game:

```bash
python quantum_main.py
```

4. Choose your game mode:
   - `0`: Play as White
   - `1`: Play as Black
5. Choose AI depth:
   - Higher values increase difficulty (but may slow performance)

## 🧪 Quantum Twist

Unlike classical chess, certain moves may result in unexpected behavior, mimicking quantum superposition. This introduces randomness and unpredictability, making each game unique.
